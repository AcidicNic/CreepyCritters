# Creepy Crawlies
A marketplace for bugs and reptiles!
###### *This is a mock website in Django for a school assignment!* [Here's my proposal!](Proposal.md)

## Who is this for?
Got a pet tarantula you don't want anymore? Or maybe you're looking to buy a cute lil scorpion? Well this is the market for you!

## How do I use it?
Head over to [the official CreepyCrawlies website](https://creepy-critters.herokuapp.com/) to browse through the critter/cryptid listings or create an account and post your own!

You can click on the Shop button to look at the critter accessories that we offers! Then just click on the Critters to head back to the critter listings.

If you make your account, click on your username in the top right corner to see your profile. Or click on any username on a listing to view their profile page.
